<p class = "blue">Therealizaion of the truth of that fact is going to act. You understand?
  And that truth, being highly intelligent, will act according to the moment.</p>
<p>what jk calls beComing, I call just ruNNing ... actually running away from wHat
iS ___observing is NOT meNtation or tHinking or conflict .. inquiring,perceiving
is Not thinking __the only pain is
runn8ng away from populations
</p>
But an idea, a concept, a
formulation can never produce 
action. I do not know if that is 
clear,or rather abstract and 
confusing. ____We are iDeas coNcepts
all the time and we want change to
happen- hahahahaha <a href="https://youtu.be/5YIwmdXfxe4?si=Ubnxbw-F69jc3LMV">coNcept or fAct</a>

    from the movie the seventh day on netflix1:02 AM He knew it was her. How? I mean she gives food to the homeless. She's an nice old lady. There wasn't anything. Look at about this Academy in Chicago, even the one in Rome. Anyone who tells you, they can teach you this in dark rooms with books and slides and lectures that they're full of shit. Okay? They give you a crucifix & hnly water. They can teach you to pray, but that's not what separates us from your average garden variety Sunday-priests. You need to be willing to put yourself in risk, okay? You need to have to strength faith, the purity of heart to allow yourself to go to places so dark so terrifying the thought of it would make those other priesthood piss in their pants. <strong>And exorcist doesn't hide from evil. He runs the towards it. He immerses himself in it</strong> so that he learns to sense it in his bowels and feel it when it's close because he knows, he needs to understand it, in order to be able to defeat it to snuff it out before it's dug in. Evil is clever, demons are unpredictable. They don't, they don't scream, they're present. They hide in places that we least expect them, so they can multiply. So they can grow more powerful right on their own houses until it's too late. Of course, I know I've been doing this for 25 years, okay? Now, if you're ready to follow me and listen and learn and do it already.
